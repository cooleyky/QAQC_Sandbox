    "# CTDMO Metadata Review\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the process for reviewing the calibration coefficients for the CTDMO IM-37. The CTDMO contains 24 different calibration coefficients to check. Additionally, possible calibration sources include vendor documents as well as the QCT check-in. \n",
    "\n",
    "A complication is that the vendor documents are principally available only as PDFs that are copies of images. This requires the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in order to parse the PDFs. Unfortunately, OCR frequently misinterprets certain character combinations, since it utilizes Levenstein-distance to do character matching. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, using OCR to read PDFs requires significant preprocessing of the PDFs to create individual PDFs with uniform metadata and encoding. Without this preprocessing, the OCR will not generate uniformly spaced characters, making parsing significantly more difficult nee impossible."

Furthermore, the files are often zipped into a single folder. So, I have the following possible vendor documents:\n",
